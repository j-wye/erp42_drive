### 1. Object Detection for Rubber Cone
- 1. Download Rubber Cone dataset
    ```bash
    # Bounding Boxes
    wget http://fsoco.cs.uni-freiburg.de/datasets/fsoco_bounding_boxes_train.zip

    # Panoptic Segmentation
    wget http://fsoco.cs.uni-freiburg.de/datasets/fsoco_segmentation_train.zip
    ```

- 2. At Roboflow, decide which YOLO version to use (e.g. YOLOv8). Then download dataset which suitale for that version

- 3. Training with selected YOLO version

- 4. Connect and detection with real-time

- 5.
